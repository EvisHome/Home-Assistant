# ApexChart Card
I use the ApexChart card quite a lot, I find it more informative with the various axis options, and I like it how it can be customized.

## ApexChart with background image

```YAML
type: custom:apexcharts-card
card_mod:
  style: |
    ha-card {
      padding-top: 10px;
      background-image: url("/local/room_bedroom.jpg");
      background-position: center;
      box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1000px rgba(0,0,0,.6);
    }
...
...
```
