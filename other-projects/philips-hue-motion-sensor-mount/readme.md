3D printable wall mount for [Philips Hue Motion sensor](https://amzn.to/3eFKGZe), give a little bit wider rotation angles, and allows easy battery changes while keeping the mount aligned to the correct direction. The mount is compatible with my ESPHome projects [Room Presence](https://github.com/EvisHome/Home-Assistant/tree/main/esphome/presence) and [Presence Box 2](https://github.com/EvisHome/Home-Assistant/tree/main/esphome/presence-box-2) and can be mixed with all the different mount options.
