# Project Box Creator

### Overview

I wanted to make it as easy as possible to start experimenting with new 3D printable project boxes. I thought I'd parametrize my previous designs with TinkerCad Codeblocks, and for my needs it works really well.

My wall mount kit works also pretty well with the boxes, naturally depends on your box dimensions in the end how well it fits.
